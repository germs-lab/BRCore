\title{Calculate Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Between Sample Pairs}
\usage{
calculate_bc(matrix, nReads)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A numeric matrix or data frame where rows represent taxa (e.g., ASVs) and columns
represent samples. The column names of the matrix are used to generate pairwise sample names.}

\item{nReads}{A numeric value representing the total number of reads used for normalization.
Typically, this is the minimum or average sequencing depth across samples.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{values}: A numeric vector of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values for each sample pair.
\item \code{names}: A character vector of pairwise sample names (e.g., "Sample1-Sample2").
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between all pairs of samples in a matrix.
The dissimilarity is normalized by the total number of reads (\code{nReads}) to account for differences
in sequencing depth.
